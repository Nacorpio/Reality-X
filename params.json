{"name":"Reality-x","tagline":"Reality-X is a simulation of the real-life universe.","body":"### What is Reality-X?\r\nReality-X is a simulation of the real-life universe and society. It's made out of APIs and projects linked together to one large project. There are many APIs, including the Economy API and the Traffic API. \r\n\r\n### What is the point of this project?\r\nFirstly, it's a lot of fun to be working on a project that simulates real life. Secondly, there are many good uses of an engine like this. For example, it can be used to see what happens if one small change is made to the economy. We will be adding a Physics-, Mechanics- and Mathematics API. Those will all make sure that this project is as realistic as possible. We're planning on making this into something that friends can do for fun as well. \r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
